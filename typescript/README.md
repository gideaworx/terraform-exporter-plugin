# `@gideaworx/terraform-exporter-plugin`

This is a WIP, and will be available for general use once it is at version
at `0.1.0`. Until then, do not expect sufficient documentation or examples.

## Usage

Create a class that extends `ExportPlugin`. Once you have done so, call `ServePlugin`
to start a GRPC server that can be used as a plugin with `terraform-exporter`.

## Examples

See the examples directory.
